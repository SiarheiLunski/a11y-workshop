    bodyText: 'Australians trusted the public service more in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic compared to before, a new survey reveals. AAP reports the survey released on Tuesday is an initiative of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and is a bid to better understand the community’s experience with public servants. The first survey was undertaken in March 2019 and the latest, the fifth of its kind, conducted in June this year. About 2500 people take part each time. It found 65 per cent of those surveyed trusted the public service in some way, with nine per cent having strong trust and the same amount (28 per cent) trusting or somewhat trusting the bureaucracy. In February, 56 per cent of Australians trusted the public service in some way, six per cent strongly. Head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Philip Gaetjens will give the keynote speech to the public service on Tuesday evening in an annual address. “The survey tells us what Australians think of their service delivery experience and identifies where the Australian public service can collectively do better,” he said prior to the speech. Another severe thunderstorm warning for parts of NSW from BoM. Police are warning people not to be duped by a scam which cost a Sydney woman $22,000, AAP reports. The 42-year-old from Sydney’s south-west received a phone call on Monday morning from a woman purporting to work at the Australian Taxation Office, telling her she owed a tax debt and the matter would be referred to police. A short time later she received a phone call from a man who claimed to be a police officer. His phone number appeared to be that of the local police station. Following the man’s instructions she withdrew cash and met him in a car park at a Wetherill Park shopping centre where she handed him $22,000. Police say to be careful of unsolicited phone calls and requests for confidential information, as legitimate businesses don’t request that kind of information on an unexpected phone call. Mick Gooda notes that promises made to raise the age of criminal responsibility and to demolish the Don Dale youth detention centre promised in 2017 have not yet been acted on. “We are still locking 10-year-olds up ... yet we had that commitment on the day ... when the chief minister committed to those two things and when he addressed the big crowd in parliament in the grounds of Parliament House that day.'

    bodyText: 'A record number of journalists were imprisoned during 2020, as governments cracked down on coverage of the coronavirus pandemic or tried to suppress reporting of civil unrest, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said on Tuesday. At least 274 journalists were in jail as of 1 December, the most since the New York-based group began collecting data in the early 1990s, the report said, up from at least 250 last year. Protests and political tensions were the cause of many arrests, with the most made in China, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, it said. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, authoritarian leaders tried to control reporting by arresting journalists. At least two journalists died after contracting the disease in custody, the report said. “It’s shocking and appalling that we are seeing a record number of journalists imprisoned in the midst of a global pandemic,” CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon said in a statement. The report blamed a lack of global leadership on democratic values, and in particular attacks on the media by US President Donald Trump, which it said gave cover to authoritarians to crack down on journalists in their own countries. Asian stocks drifted lower on Tuesday as worries about increasing Covid-19 deaths and lockdowns overshadowed optimism about the roll-out of coronavirus vaccinations, Reuters reports. Markets showed little reaction to China’s industrial output, which grew in line with expectations in November, expanding for an eighth straight month as an economic recovery gathered pace. The number of coronavirus deaths in the United States crossed 300,000 on Monday as the hardest hit nation started its first vaccine inoculations. “Considerable uncertainty surrounds the timeline for rollout but key safety milestones could be met by around mid 2021,” economists at Westpac said in a note. “Meanwhile several jurisdictions continue to struggle with major outbreaks with a particularly notable rise in cases in the US,” they said. Most Asian markets retreated in early trade, with MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan falling 0.4%, having hit a string of record highs last week. E-mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.1%. Chinese stocks were down 0.2%.'

    bodyText: 'In 2017, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. The official number of casualties as a result of the storm is 64. But take into account the longer-term consequences – devastated infrastructure, overwhelmed hospitals – and the death toll rises to the thousands. When we look closely at these figures, we see something else too: two months afterwards, mortality had risen sharply for the lowest socioeconomic group, somewhat for the middle group, and least for the highest group. A huge external shock had thrust the underlying inequalities in society into sharp relief. So it has been with Covid-19. Inequalities in health, and in the social conditions that lead to ill health, have been revealed and amplified by the pandemic and the response to it. Now, with vaccines coming onstream, there is talk of Britain getting back to “normal”. But the “normal” that existed in February 2020 is not acceptable. The Covid-19 pandemic must be taken as an opportunity to build a fairer society. A new report that my colleagues and I at UCL have published today uses evidence to suggest how we go about doing this. In February 2020, just one month before the UK entered a national lockdown, we published a review of what had happened to Britain’s health and health inequalities in the 10 years since 2010. The picture was bleak: stalling life expectancy and rising inequalities between socioeconomic groups and regions. Most remarkable was the bucking of a long-term trend of health improving year on year: a woman living in the most deprived area in north-east England, or other areas outside London, had less chance of living a long and healthy life in 2019 than she would have had 10 years ago. We made a series of recommendations, addressing the social determinants of health, for how things could and should improve. Then, Covid-19 changed the world dramatically. But in England the changes have been entirely consistent with its state before the pandemic hit. England’s comparatively poor management of the pandemic was of a piece with its health improvement falling behind that of other rich countries in the previous decade. There are four possible explanations: the quality of governance and political culture, which did not prioritise the conditions for good health; continuing increases in economic and social inequalities, including a rise in poverty among families with children; a policy of austerity and consequent cuts to funding of public services that were sharply regressive; and a poor state of the nation’s health. Addressing all four of these is at the heart of what needs to be done to bring about change.'

    bodyText: 'It was an unexpected twist in what already felt like an excessively dramatic disaster movie. On 6 April, the British prime minister was admitted to the intensive care ward at St Thomas’ hospital in London, after contracting a new and potentially deadly virus. Donald Trump said he was “praying for his good friend”; the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said all his wishes were with the prime minister, his family and the British people in “this difficult time”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, described it as “terribly sad news”. Boris Johnson pulled through, of course, surviving to witness the birth of his son, Wilfred – given the middle name Nicholas, after the doctors, Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart, who saved Johnson’s life. But more than eight months later, could the country still be feeling the impact of this dramatic turn of events? Just two weeks after the UK was ordered to “stay at home”, Johnson’s hospital admission with Covid-19 underscored the severity of the situation. “Boris was somebody who never got ill, didn’t understand illness, he just sort of blathered on straight through it,” says Prof Matthew Flinders, the founding director of the Sir Bernard Crick Centre for the Public Understanding of Politics at the University of Sheffield. Flinders shadowed the PM during his time as London mayor: “When people realised that Boris had got it, it was like: ‘Bloody hell, this is really serious’ – and when he was moved to intensive care, this concern intensified.” Johnson’s diagnosis ramped up the fear factor, which may have boosted people’s compliance with the new restrictions. “It also made Boris seem like, dare I say, like a ‘normal person’; the Eton education, Bullingdon club and Oxford Union suddenly mattered less if he could catch the virus like you or me,” Flinders says. In the short term, this public sympathy benefited the PM. After his hospital admission, the proportion of people with a favourable opinion of him rose from 54% to 60%, a YouGov poll revealed. Social scientists refer to this as the “rally around the flag” effect. “In any period of uncertainty or crisis, people tend to associate criticism with disloyalty and being unpatriotic, so he had a bit of a ‘Boris bounce’ due to the illness,” says Flinders. Sadly for Johnson, this quickly dissipated. Since returning to work, Johnson has faced criticism over his handling of the pandemic and rumours that he has lost his mojo. By the end of September, his public favourability rating had dropped to 33%. “Lots of cabinet colleagues have complained that he’s not his old self, he’s a bit below par and hasn’t got that energy, that buzz, when he walks into a room,” says Flinders. Of course, Johnson disagrees: “I could refute these critics of my athletic abilities in any way they want: arm-wrestle, leg-wrestle, Cumberland wrestle, sprint-off, you name it,” he argued in October in his party conference speech. Without medical assessment, it is impossible to know if his illness has left a psychological mark on the PM, says Prof Neil Greenberg, a consultant occupational and forensic psychiatrist at King’s College London.'

    bodyText: 'Every Perfume Genius album marks some kind of transition. When singer Mike Hadreas released his 2010 debut, the intimate, introspective Learning, he emerged boyish and fragile, contrasting lo-fi production with watertight melodies. He has unfurled with each subsequent record: Put Your Back N 2 It was less timid, the previously muted and muffled DIY production replaced with something brighter and assured. Too Bright and No Shape were even bolder and experimental, as metallic electronics and a wide berth of instrumentation complemented songs that merged the personal with the political: “No family is safe when I sashay,” he sang on Queen. His fifth album, the brilliant Set My Heart on Fire Immediately, is just as transformative, albeit subtly so. After working on collaborative dance project The Sun Still Burns Here with Seattle-based choreographer Kate Wallich, Hadreas, who has struggled with substance abuse and lives with Crohn’s disease, said that he felt a renewed relationship with his body. Unshackled from the emotional and physical limitations he’d placed on himself because of addiction and chronic illness, he asks: Can I be something or someone different? Drawing on motifs broadly across America’s pantheon of pop – from the melodrama of Roy Orbison, the twang of Dolly Parton and the angst of Cyndi Lauper – the journey he takes us on as he figures it all out results in some of his most accomplished and confident music yet. Hadreas’s work has always dealt with heavy themes such as abuse and bullying, but with the opener of Set My Heart on Fire Immediately, he asks to be relinquished of his trauma. “Let it drift and wash away,” he sings over the warbled synths of Whole Life. “The mark where he left me. A clip on my wing. Oh, let it soften; I forgive everything.” Absolution prompts a tug of war as Hadreas pushes at the boundaries of his new emancipated being. The galloping Your Body Changes Everything is a power struggle, the binaries between submission and dominance eroding until any prescribed sense of existence becomes as shapeless as the song’s conclusion. On Without You, he briefly finds self-confidence, his reflection in a mirror causing “the strangest feeling … Almost good.” It’s a fleeting but “it’s enough. Not too loud. Just enough to find the trace.”'

    bodyText: 'This absorbing, harrowing documentary from Romanian director Alexander Nanau shines a spotlight on an awful episode in the country’s recent history: a nightclub fire in 2015 that claimed 64 lives, many of them as a result of bacterial infections while they were being treated in hospital for their burns. The ensuing scandal exposed a seam of corruption and gangsterism in the medical authorities, and brought down the government. The bare details of what happened pack a hell of a punch. In the first few minutes of the film, we see footage from inside the club as the blaze takes hold: on-stage fireworks ignite wall panels during the live set of an angry metal band called Goodbye to Gravity. As realisation dawns on the band, and audience panic sets in, there’s a frantic scramble for the exit in a near-identical manner to the 2003 Station nightclub fire in Rhode Island that claimed even more lives. Nanau’s film, however, really picks up some time later, after questions emerge as to why so many victims died later, of hospital-borne bacterial infections. A team of journalists from the sports paper Gazeta Sporturilor, led by Cătălin Tolontan and Mirela Neag, are the focus, as they interview whistleblowers, amass documentation, take surreptitious photographs and get awkward with government spokespeople. The journalists’ doggedness gets results, and it’s an absorbing record of how and where investigation really happens: on meandering phone calls, in badly lit meeting rooms and – crucially – tapping away at computers. This kind of activity, of course, is not vivid enough for feature-film depictions of journalism – and, what’s more, a conventional rendering of all this would climax with the scalp of the country’s health minister, who abruptly resigns when the dimensions of the scandal – the corrupt purchase of illegally diluted cleaning fluid – emerge. But the domino effect of the revelations creates its own momentum, meaning the story rolls on in expected ways, heading into sinister territory and excavating a toxic reservoir that would appear to infect wider society. A narrative as powerful as this would be enough for any documentary, but what marks Collective out as truly exceptional is the way it quietly mutates halfway through: the focus shifts from the journalists to the new-broom health minister Vlad Voiculescu, a former patients-rights activist, as he attempts to grapple with the disaster. Voiculescu is part of a technocratic cabinet, with no specific political affiliation, and the film presents him very much in that light: a fresh-faced campaigner of noble intentions who has to wise up fast in the face of bureaucratic hostility and orchestrated media attacks. What Collective does so impressively is show how investigation, regulation and reform are never ends in themselves: they are all part of an ongoing effort against moving targets – meaning the story never really ends. Whatever triumphs the film records, there is always the likelihood of trouble ahead – and this is a takeaway for every democratic society, not just post-communist ones. It’s a message we have to heed.'

    bodyText: 'England’s poorest people have the shortest appointments with their GP and the richest get the longest, a study reveals. People from the most deprived areas get the least amount of time when seeing their family doctor, despite having the worst underlying health in the population, researchers found. While those in the richest areas get 11.2 minutes on average, people in the most deprived neighbourhoods get 10.7 minutes, according to the Health Foundation. The disparity underlines the inequality in access to NHS care, and has prompted concern that people on low incomes are missing out on opportunities to improve their health. Health Foundation experts led by Mai Stafford, a principal data analyst at the thinktank, uncovered the gap from studying records of 1.2m consultations involving 190,036 patients from 2014-16. In findings reported in the British Journal of General Practice, she and her colleagues said it was “particularly concerning” that people from deprived areas had shorter consultations. They linked the situation to poorer areas having fewer family doctors than better-off areas, with GP surgeries having heavier workloads because patients are on average sicker than their richer neighbours. “These findings add further detail to an already stark picture of health inequality in England. Those living in the poorest areas of the country already tend to experience worse health and have fewer doctors per patient,” said Stafford. “That they also tend to have less time with their GP, even when they have greater need, is especially worrying at a time when Covid-19 has further widened the gap in health between the richest and poorest.” The inequity is so great that a patient from a deprived area who has underlying physical and mental health conditions gets the same amount of time with a GP – 10.9 minutes – as someone from a wealthy area who has no underlying health problems. The researchers concluded that “there could be unmet need among patients with complex care needs, particularly patients living in deprived areas with both mental and physical health conditions.” Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: “Access to GP care should not be dependent on where a patient lives. These findings are concerning, but not altogether surprising as we know that areas of high deprivation also tend to have some of the most pronounced GP shortages. “The paradox is that people living in more deprived areas also tend to have a greater number of long-term health conditions and more complex health needs, and therefore often require greater access to GP care and services.” He called on NHS bosses to urgently try to attract more GPs to work in poorer areas. NHS England has tried in recent years to tackle the problem of “under-doctoring” of poorer places, as well as some coastal and rural areas, by offering GP trainees £20,000 incentives. But it is unclear how many newly qualified doctors have started their career in general practice as a result of that scheme. The government missed a target it set in 2015 to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000. Boris Johnson has pledged to increase the GP workforce by 6,000 by 2024.'

    bodyText: 'Scientists are preparing for an urgent mission to the world’s biggest iceberg, which is on a collision course with the island of South Georgia in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The A-68A iceberg, which is larger than Luxembourg, broke off from the Larsen C ice shelf in Antarctica in 2017 and has been drifting towards the island ever since. It threatens to wreck the rich ecosystem around South Georgia by tearing up the sea floor, which is home to molluscs, crustaceans, sponges and other life, and by chilling the water and releasing meltwater into the sea. Researchers at British Antarctic Survey (BAS) will fly out to the Falklands on 11 January, quarantine themselves to ensure they are free from coronavirus, and then embark on a three-day voyage to the iceberg onboard the research ship the RRS James Cook. “Even though icebergs are common, we’ve never had anything this size before, so it’s a first for us,” said Prof Geraint Tarling, a biological oceanographer at BAS. “It brings a wholesale change to the environment.” Strong ocean currents are steering the iceberg, which has a surface area of around 1,500 sq miles (4,000 sq km), from deep water towards the shallower waters of the continental shelf that surrounds South Georgia. The edge of the shelf is rich in phytoplankton, krill and other species low on the food chain, making it an important feeding ground for penguins, seals and whales. “The biodiversity of this area is as rich as you’d find in the Galápagos,” said Tarling. The waters around South Georgia are about 4C, but in the vicinity of the iceberg the temperature could fall a couple of degrees. The cooler temperature and release of what could potentially be billions of tonnes of fresh water into the region could be devastating for the feeding ground. “If the iceberg does ground, we could be looking at this being there for up to 10 years because it’s so large. It’ll be a huge problem,” said Tarling. Beyond disrupting the ecosystem, if the iceberg gets stuck on the continental shelf it will block off a large stretch of feeding ground where krill are most abundant. That could prevent penguins and seals from finding food nearby for themselves and their young in the breeding season. Tarling said that while whales might be able to find other feeding grounds, large colonies of penguins and seals could not leave the island to go far. “They are fixed to their base and without being able to get out, feed and get back quickly, they have got a real problem.” When the research ship arrives at the iceberg, the scientists will use nets and bottles to collect and study animals in the water. Two robotic submarines called gliders will be launched to measure the temperature, salinity and levels of phytoplankton in the water around the iceberg. The gliders will patrol the region for four months, rising from their dives and transmitting data back to the ship. By combining this information with that from the ship-based studies, scientists will build up a picture of the iceberg’s impact on the environment. Povl Abrahamsen, the chief scientist on the mission at BAS, said the latest images showed the iceberg was about 60 miles off the coast of South Georgia. “It may be the iceberg ends up bumping and scraping along the edge of the shelf or breaks clear of the islands. But it may also get grounded and stay around for months or years. At this stage it’s very difficult to predict what will happen next,” he said.'

    bodyText: 'Lapland is not so much a country, more a way of life, where the nomadic Sami people live and work alongside their famous reindeer herds. What we know as “Lapland”- and they call Sápmi – covers an area of land straddling the Arctic Circle, and running from the northern part of Norway in the west, through Sweden and Finland, to the Kola peninsula of Arctic Russia in the east. Most of this area is a high plateau, covered with pine and spruce forests called taiga, which gradually thin out towards the north to be replaced by tundra. Winters are long, dark and cold, with snow starting to arrive as early as August, and covering the ground from October through to the following spring – peaking as late as April. The average winter temperatures are a few degrees zero in the north and marginally less cold in the south, where there is also more precipitation. Summers, however, are very different: mean temperatures are in the low teens (C), while during heatwaves they can rise well into the 20Cs. However, recent summers have had unseasonably high temperatures, with records being not just broken, but smashed, a result of the global climate emergency. In July 2018, Rovaniemi, the capital of Finnish Lapland – the self-styled “official hometown of Santa Claus” – recorded an unprecedented high of 32C (90F).'
